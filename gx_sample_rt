Step 1: Setup Great Expectations in Your Databricks Notebook
Install Great Expectations if you haven't already:

python
Copy code
# Install Great Expectations
%pip install great_expectations
Import Required Libraries:

python
Copy code
from great_expectations.data_context import DataContext
from great_expectations.dataset.sparkdf_dataset import SparkDFDataset
from great_expectations.core import ExpectationConfiguration
from great_expectations.core.batch import Batch
from great_expectations.core.batch import BatchRequest
import great_expectations as ge
Step 2: Initialize Great Expectations
You need to create a DataContext and configure it to use your existing great_expectations directory, or you can initialize a new one.

python
Copy code
# Initialize Great Expectations DataContext
context = ge.data_context.DataContext("/databricks/driver/great_expectations")
Step 3: Define Expectations for Your Table
Here’s a sample code to validate the table structure:

Load Your Spark DataFrame:

python
Copy code
# Load your table into a Spark DataFrame
df = spark.table("your_table_name")

# Convert to Great Expectations dataset
df_ge = SparkDFDataset(df)
Expectation Suite:

Create an expectation suite if it doesn’t exist. This step is typically done once.

python
Copy code
# Create a new expectation suite
context.create_expectation_suite(
    expectation_suite_name="your_suite_name",
    overwrite_existing=True
)
Define Expectations:

Here’s how you can validate the table structure, including renamed columns and new columns.

python
Copy code
# Define your expectation suite
suite = context.get_expectation_suite("your_suite_name")

# Define expectations
# Check column names
expected_column_names = ["new_col1", "new_col2", "new_col3", "new_col4"]  # Adjust column names accordingly
df_ge.expect_table_column_count_to_equal(len(expected_column_names))

for col_name in expected_column_names:
    df_ge.expect_column_to_exist(col_name)

# Check column names are as expected
df_ge.expect_table_column_count_to_equal(len(expected_column_names))
Add Expectations for Data Quality:

If you want to add expectations for the new column, e.g., it should not have any null values, you can add:

python
Copy code
# Check new column does not have null values
df_ge.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("new_col4")
Step 4: Validate the Expectations
To run the validations, use:

python
Copy code
# Validate the dataframe against the expectation suite
results = context.run_validation_operator(
    "action_list_operator",
    batch_request=BatchRequest(
        datasource_name="your_datasource",
        data_connector_name="default_inferred_data_connector_name",
        data_asset_name="your_table_name"
    ),
    expectation_suite_name="your_suite_name"
)

# Display results
print(results)
Step 5: Save and Run Your Notebook
Save the notebook.
Run the notebook to execute the validation.
Notes
Replace Placeholder Values: Make sure to replace "your_table_name", "your_suite_name", and column names with actual values relevant to your table and expectations.

Great Expectations Configuration: Ensure your great_expectations directory is properly set up. If not, you might need to initialize it in your notebook or set it up through Databricks.

DataContext Path: Adjust the path to the great_expectations directory according to where it's set up in your Databricks environment.

This approach will validate that your table structure meets your expectations, ensuring that the columns are renamed correctly and that new columns are added as required.
