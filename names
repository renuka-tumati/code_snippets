ML/AI algorith names, easy to pronounce.

Kmeans : K-Means Clustering: A popular clustering algorithm.
DBscan : Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise A clustering algorithm that identifies clusters based on density and is robust to noise.
LASSO: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator: A regression method that performs variable selection and regularization.
Ridge: Ridge Regression: A linear model with L2 regularization.
Turing:  theoretical model that defines the limits of what can be computed by an algorithm.
Floyd: Calculates shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.
Bellman: Finds shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices in a graph, handling negative weights.

Random Forest: A robust ensemble learning method for classification and regression.
Decision Tree: A model that makes decisions based on feature values.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.

Vector: A mathematical entity with both magnitude and direction, used to represent data points in machine learning.
Tensor: A multi-dimensional array used to store and manipulate complex data in AI and machine learning.
Optimizer: An algorithm that adjusts the weights of a neural network to minimize the loss function during training.
Bayesian: A statistical method that updates the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available.
Kernel: A function used in machine learning algorithms like SVM to transform data into a higher-dimensional space.
Gradient: The vector of partial derivatives used in optimization algorithms to find the direction of steepest ascent or descent.
